A drone project currently only for the cx-10 drone. Very work-in-progressy.
Based on [hack-a-drone] and it's parent project [wifi_china_drone_controller]

* smoothing when using the keyboard
* ability to adjust trim
* ability to adjust sensitivity
* tell the user if the current network name doesn't look like a drone name
  
## Long Term Plans

* autonomous flight using ar markers as checkpoints
* autonomous flight using monocular SLAM
